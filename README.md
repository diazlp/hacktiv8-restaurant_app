# Hacktiv8 Restaurant App

This simple hacktiv8 restaurant app is built using *vanilla JS* with [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp), the whole app is using dummy data (no API fetching) and built thoroughly with semantic HTML and also *vanilla CSS*

The app most probably is NOT responsive (let alone interactive per se), soo.. here goes nothing

The reason I published this so reviewers and assigners can see the live app, and easily scores it

It might get taken down  for public viewing sooner or later.
